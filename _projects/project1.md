			<p align="justify">
					The number of devices that make up the Internet of Things (IoT) has been increasing every year, including smart speakers. 
					These devices have become very popular around the world, and it is estimated that this year there will be 83.1 million users with a smart speaker. 
					However, there has also been great concern about how they can affect the privacy and security of users. Therefore, it is essential to carry out studies that shed light on this unknown. 
					This approach is the one developed in this project. 
					Specifically, the possibility to detect the user who has issued a voice command is being studied through the analysis of network traffic, which would allow knowing critical information about users.
